- Redesign Start Menu  to behave as a wizard menu - first ask user to load files, then process them and then ask where to save them.- Make load data from previously saved file available
- Make save settings to file and load them at program start
- Refactor classes in order to be more OOP:
-- make menus to be with the composite design
-- split ProcessVCFs class in to smaller classes
- Make save to/load from different file formats
